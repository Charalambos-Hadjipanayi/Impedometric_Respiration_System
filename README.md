# Impedometric Respiration System

Learning Objectives of Project

• To understand the concept of system-level design by identifying the subsystems needed to compose the prototype of an impedancerespirometer.

• To build part of a prototype impedometric pneumometer on a stripboard by populating it with electronic components and soldering themin to the correct place. This aims at developing practical development, isntrumentation & debugging skills.

• To familiarise with the practical aspects related to the basic testing of an instrument prototype.

• To identify & appreciate block-level deviations from ideality and how these affect system-level performance.
